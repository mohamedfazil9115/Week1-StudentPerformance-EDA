Student Performance Analysis â€“ Overview

This project explores how students perform in math, reading, and writing based on various factors such as gender, lunch type, and parental education level.

Using Python libraries, we analyze patterns in the data and visualize the results to better understand student performance.

What We Did

Uploaded the Dataset
Loaded a CSV file containing information about students and their test scores.

Explored the Data
Viewed the first few rows, checked for missing values, and reviewed basic statistics.

Analyzed Performance
Grouped data to compare average scores based on:

Gender

Type of lunch (standard vs. free/reduced)

Parental level of education

Visualized the Data
Created charts to help understand the data:

Histogram of math scores

Boxplot of math scores by gender

Bar chart of reading scores by parental education

Heatmap showing correlations between math, reading, and writing scores

Key Insights

Students who completed test preparation scored higher across all subjects.

Female students performed better in reading and writing; males scored slightly higher in math.

Students with parents who have higher education levels performed better.

Students who received standard lunch scored better than those with free/reduced lunch.

Math, reading, and writing scores are strongly correlated.

Tools Used

Pandas for data analysis

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

Google Colab for running the code
